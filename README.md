## Task 2 : MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

> Building a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.

> The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.


> Movie Rating Prediction project enables us to explore data
analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques. It provides useful insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

## Task 5 : CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

> Building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.

> Preprocessing and normalizing the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

> Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.

## Task 4 : SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

> Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.

>In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data
Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine
learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing
them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By
leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their
advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.
